# Graphic Generation Workflow (posters, covers, social & marketing assets)

Use this workflow when the user asks for a **static poster-like artwork** — poster, flyer, cover art, album/book cover, event visual, social media graphic, banner artwork — rather than a web page or app screen. It replaces all of the UI SOPs in SUPERDESIGN.md.

CLI setup, login, and canvas-URL surfacing live in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) (the "Superdesign CLI", "When a command fails", and "Surface the canvas URL" sections) — follow those. From [SUPERDESIGN.md](SUPERDESIGN.md), only these sections apply to graphics: the COMMAND CONTRACT, VERSION HISTORY & REVERT, TOOL USE RULE, and USER REQUEST PASSING. The init/design-system gates do NOT apply here: a standalone poster/marketing asset needs no repo init, no `.superdesign/init/` files, and no `design-system.md`/`globals.css` context — the brief carries the style. Design-system/brand context comes in only when the user wants on-brand output matching an existing codebase — asked explicitly, or confirmed via the Step 1 brief's on-brand item; run init first only if that context doesn't already exist.

Core idea: **you** produce the key visual with your own image-generation tool, upload it to Superdesign, and let Superdesign compose the graphic as pixel-perfect HTML on a fixed canvas. Text is always rendered by the HTML layer, never baked into images — that is what keeps graphics sharp, editable, and iterable.

A graphic lives in a project like any draft. Reuse the current project or `create-project --title "<topic> Graphics"` first.

## Overview

1. Confirm the brief (copy, canvas, layout, style, asset plan) — ONE confirmation round
2. Generate the key visual with your own image tool (only if the layout needs one)
3. `upload-asset` → public URL
4. `create-design-draft --kind graphic` with the assembled prompt
5. Share the canvas link, iterate on feedback

## Step 1 — Confirm the brief (one round, not three)

Draft a concrete proposal yourself, then confirm it with the user in a SINGLE round using your question/confirmation mechanism. Skip confirmation entirely when the user already gave full specs or says to generate directly.

**Diverge first on open-ended requests:** when the request is simple and open-ended (one sentence, no strong constraints), do not settle on a single proposal — present THREE genuinely distinct creative directions inside this same brief round, never as a separate round. Each direction is 1-2 lines carrying its own **layout + style + asset plan**, and the three must differ substantially (not three shades of one idea); the shared items (purpose, verbatim copy, canvas) are confirmed once for all three. Recommend trying all three as parallel variants for side-by-side comparison on the canvas, noting that picking just one (or two) is a fine choice. If the user accepts trying all three, that counts as an explicit request for three variants (generate them with `--mode branch` — see the VARIANT COUNT RULE in [SUPERDESIGN.md](SUPERDESIGN.md)). For requests that already carry a clear spec, skip the divergence and confirm the single brief.

Cover these items:

- **Purpose**: what the poster announces/sells and where it will be shown.
- **Verbatim copy**: the exact headline, subhead, info lines (date/venue/price/URL), and footer. Write them out and get them locked — the generator reproduces these strings EXACTLY, so typos and missing lines here become typos on the poster.
- **Canvas**: pick from the presets below (user-given dimensions always win).
- **Layout**: recommend ONE from the menu with a one-line reason; let the user swap.
- **Style + asset plan**: 2-3 style adjectives with a rough palette, and the asset plan implied by the layout (AI-generate / user provides a file / no imagery).
- **On-brand?** — only when the workspace is a real product codebase (per SKILL.md Step 1): confirm in this same round whether the artwork should match the product's brand. **Yes** → pass `.superdesign/design-system.md` and/or the init `theme.md` tokens as `--context-file` if they already exist; if neither exists, run repo init first (per SKILL.md) and pass the init `theme.md` tokens — init does not create `design-system.md`, and a poster doesn't need one. **No** → stay standalone (the default). Skip this item entirely outside a real codebase.

### Canvas presets

| Use case                     | Canvas (`--width`x`--height`) | Image-gen aspect for assets |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Portrait poster / print-like | 900x1200                      | portrait (e.g. 1024x1536)   |
| Square social post           | 1080x1080                     | square (1024x1024)          |
| Story / vertical social      | 1080x1920                     | portrait (1024x1536)        |
| Landscape banner / header    | 1500x750                      | landscape (1536x1024)       |

Image tools only offer fixed size steps — match the nearest **aspect**, not exact pixels; the poster layer crops with `object-cover`.

### Platform-specific marketing assets

When the poster is a marketing asset for a specific platform (feed post, story, cover, thumbnail, ad creative), use the exact platform dimension instead of the generic presets — and MUST confirm the dimension with the user before creating; do NOT assume it. The "recommended" size for a platform with multiple options is a starting suggestion, not a default you may skip confirming.

| Category  | Platform               | Asset Type            | Aspect Ratio | Recommended Size (px) |

Small ad units (leaderboards, banners, squares under ~400px) are micro-layouts: default to the type-hero or split layout at reduced scale, skip generated key visuals below 300px on the short side, and keep copy to a headline + CTA.

### Layout menu (pick exactly one)

| Layout             | Composition skeleton                                                                                          | Whitespace                 | Key visual                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **type-hero**      | Giant headline dominates (~8-20% of canvas height), tight leading; small info block + footer on a strict grid | 60-70%                     | none — typography IS the poster            |
| **full-bleed**     | Key visual fills the whole canvas; text overlaid on a darkened/tinted zone or gradient scrim                  | 30-40% clear zone for text | background image (no text in it)           |
| **split**          | Canvas divided (top/bottom or left/right ~55/45): one zone pure imagery, the other a clean info panel         | 40-50% in info zone        | subject image (product, artwork, portrait) |
| **list**           | Title band + 3-7 numbered/bulleted entries on an aligned grid; compact footer                                 | 20-35%                     | optional small accent image or none        |
| **centered-badge** | Everything centered and symmetric like a certificate/invitation: ornament, headline, details stacked          | 50-60%                     | optional decorative motif                  |

Routing hints: slogan/quote/announcement → type-hero; concert/film/album/atmosphere → full-bleed; product/exhibition piece → split; agenda/ranking/menu → list; invitation/award → centered-badge.

## Step 2 — Key visual (your own image tool)

Only for layouts that need one (see menu). Rules for the image prompt:

- Subject + composition first, then style and palette (carry the confirmed style adjectives; name 2-3 hex-ish colors).
- Tell the model to **leave clear negative space** where the layout will place the headline (e.g. "upper third clean and uncluttered").
- **ABSOLUTELY NO TEXT in the image**: no letters, words, logos, watermarks, or UI. Text belongs to the poster layer.
- Use the aspect from the canvas table.

Show the generated image to the user and offer one regenerate/adjust round (more only if they ask). While looking at the image, write yourself a short **visual description** — dominant colors (approximate hex), composition, where the negative space is. You will paste this into the graphic prompt so the layout generator can match colors and place text without seeing the image.

If the user provides their own image file, skip generation and continue with upload.

## Step 3 — Upload the asset

```bash
npx --yes @superdesign/cli@latest upload-asset <file> --project-id <projectId>
```

Accepts png/jpeg/webp/gif up to 10MB and prints a public `url` — that URL is what goes into the graphic prompt. Upload each asset once and reuse the URL across drafts/iterations. The asset also appears on the project canvas as an image node next to the graphic drafts (pass `--no-canvas` to skip that).

## Step 4 — Generate the graphic

```bash
npx --yes @superdesign/cli@latest create-design-draft --project-id <id> \
  --title "<Poster title>" --kind graphic --width <W> --height <H> \
  -p "<assembled prompt>"
```

Assemble the single `-p` prompt from the confirmed brief:

```text
Design a static graphic. The canvas is EXACTLY <W>x<H>px — nothing may overflow or scroll.

LAYOUT — <layout name>: <composition skeleton from the menu, expanded with your art direction>

COPY (reproduce these strings EXACTLY — no rewording, no additions):
- Headline: "<...>"
- Subhead: "<...>"
- Info: <date / venue / price / URL lines>
- Footer: "<...>"

KEY VISUAL: use <asset url> as the <background / subject / accent per layout> — embed via <img> or CSS background-image with object-cover, never distort. The image is: <your visual description: palette hexes, composition, where the negative space is>. Match the poster's remaining colors and text placement to it.

STYLE: <style adjectives, palette, font character (e.g. heavy grotesque headline + light mono captions)>.
```

Omit the KEY VISUAL block for asset-less layouts.

## Step 5 — Review & iterate

### Visual self-review (one round)

Treat a generated graphic as unfinished until you have looked at the render yourself. In Codex Work environments a browser is always available for this:

- In ChatGPT Work Mode, always use the cloud browser available to that chat. If it is not initially visible, load the Browser skill and follow its setup instructions before concluding it is unavailable.
- In Codex Desktop, use `@Browser` and explicitly select the in-app surface with `agent.browsers.get("iab")`. Use Chrome only when the user asks for it, the task needs an existing Chrome tab/login/profile/extension, or the in-app Browser is unavailable or blocked.
- In other environments, use whatever your host provides (a sandboxed screenshot/preview tool, or a browser tool with vision). If you genuinely cannot see the render, skip the review and tell the user plainly that you have not visually verified it — do not imply you checked.

Open the draft's `preview` URL and judge it as a designer would: every copy string reproduced verbatim (headline, info lines, footer — no typos, no rewording), nothing overflowing the fixed canvas, text legible where it sits over the key visual, sensible image crop, and general layout/contrast/typography quality. If you spot concrete issues, run EXACTLY ONE `iterate-design-draft --mode replace` fix round and re-check — one round only, never keep looping on your own.

### Deliver

- Give the user the `canvas` link from the command output. The `preview` link is for your own visual self-review (above); share it only if the user asks for a direct render.
- Iterate with `iterate-design-draft` as usual — drafts created with `--kind graphic` stay in graphic mode server-side, so plain instructions like "make the headline bigger" are safe.
- `--mode branch` works well for exploring 2-3 poster directions from the same brief and asset.

## Series (multiple graphics)

Never use flow pages for posters. One poster = one `create-design-draft` call; for a series, keep the copy per poster but reuse the same style direction and asset URLs so the set stays coherent, and generate the shared key visual once before the first poster.
